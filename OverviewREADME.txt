I'd just like to add some brief context to both of these examples. Both of these examples are taken from the best two games I have made during my time here at RIT. The first, Natural Selection, was made at the end of my freshman year, in Microsoft's XNA 4.0 framework(in C#). The second, Southern, but Love, was made at the end of my third year here at RIT, and is made in Unity(also C#). Both projects were team projects in which we chose our project roles. For both projects, I chose to be the level designer for the game and my main coding experience came in level loading. Both of these examples are the methods used in order to load the games' levels, as well as the files I used to design the level to be loaded.
Also, the projects' code that I am including in these examples come from school projects that are more than 6 months in the past. During my coop, I worked a lot with javascript as well as HTML and CSS for web application development for mobile and web. I cannot include examples of this code, as I signed a non-disclosure agreement with my company, but I just wanted to make clear that my coding and coding standards have improved greatly over the last few months working with Bross Group. I have learned a great deal from working outside of the classroom, and feel as though these examples, while solid, are not a complete picture of my coding skills. Thank you again for your consideration.

Southern, but Love was a short, 5 week rapid game prototype that I worked on with a team of 4 other students. It is a side-scrolling infinite runner game (though it does have an end) that was made with Unity and coded with C#.
For this project, I was in charge of level design. This included laying out the level segments of the game and loading the level objects in via a CSV file. The levels are loaded as segments rather than a single CSV file so that we could load them in randomly and continuously in future development for the "infinite" part of the infinite runner. This is an example of one of those levels.

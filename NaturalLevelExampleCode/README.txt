Natural Selection was a 2D side-scrolling platformer made in Microsoft's XNA 4.0 framework. It was made in 15 weeks at the end of my freshman year with a team of 3 other students. 
For this project I chose to be the level designer of the project, as well as the person in charge of the collectibles of the game. For the level, I used a tile system and loaded each piece of the game in a different character in text file. For example, each background tile was a "." in the text file, and each element of the game was loaded in this same format. The level is loaded into the game at the start, all at once, via this text file and parsed into the objects for the game to render. In hindsight, there is probably a better way to load the level in as pieces rather than all at once.
